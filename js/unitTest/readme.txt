Type UnitTest(); in the console to run the whole unit test suite; Type UNIT_TEST_FNS there to get the list of functions with unit tests.
Call UnitTest with an Array of String included in UNIT_TEST_FNS as its argument to test the corresponding functions only.
Idempotent functions are tested to ensure the same initial states and input sequences always give the same expected output sequences.
Note that the micro version of the app doesn't have any unit test.
